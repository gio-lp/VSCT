    m_Localized: Once the Training phase is over, you can move on to Testing. You
      will be in the same virtual environment but this time you will not be able
      to turn around and will have to answer a series of questions based on the objects
      in front of you.

    m_Localized: Here is an example of the first question. You will have to indicate
      by pulling the trigger of your joystick the object that is behind the two objects
      in front of you in the scene.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 21297664905216

      update your mental map; otherwise, keep the configuration of the objects in
      mind and click "Next." The task will end when you can no longer change the
      scene. Good luck!
